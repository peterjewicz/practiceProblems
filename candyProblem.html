// We have a bunch of kids and in the list/array there is shown how much candy each kid has (positive integer).

// Because we don't want kids to argue, we want each kid to have the same amount of candies, but we can't take candies from kids.

// Your job is to give all the kids the same amount of candies as the kid with the most candies and then return the total number candies that have been given out. If there are no kids, or 1, return -1.

// candies ([5,8,6,4]) // return 9

// candies ([1,2,4,6]) // return 11

// candies ([]) // return -1
